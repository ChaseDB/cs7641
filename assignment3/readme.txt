No arguments required, just download and run optimization.py with a python 3 prompt. It does require a newer version of scikit-learn (0.24.1) however. The above link
should include a requirements.txt which can be used to configure an environment if needed. The script will run against shill.csv for the neural network weight training
segment, and will use houston2008_order.csv for the TSP problem. The output of running the script is a group of 3 folders (one for each problem) local to the optimization.py script.
The folders contain subfolders with charts for each of the 4 algorithms run against that problem. A metrics.txt file is generated to provide extra technical data used in tables.
