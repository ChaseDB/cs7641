No arguments required, just download and run unsupervised.py with a python 3 prompt. The final part involving the neural network is handled by running algorithms.py AFTER running unsupervised.py.
The above link should include a requirements.txt which can be used to configure an environment if needed. The output of running the scripts is a group of many folders containing charts, as well as 
nn_metrics.txt which contains additional verbose information about the result of running the neural network experiment in algorithms.py
