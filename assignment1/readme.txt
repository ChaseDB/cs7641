No arguments required, just download and run algorithms.py with a python 3 prompt. It does require a newer version of scikit-learn (0.24.1) however. The above link
should include a requirements.txt which can be used to configure an environment if needed. The script will run against cardiotocogram.csv and shill.csv as long as they
are local to it. The output of running the script is two folders - cardio and shill. The folders contain subfolders with charts for each of the 5 algorithms. Local to 
algorithms.py, a file called 'metrics.txt' will also be generated containing various metrics used in the paper. The sources.txt contains the urls to get the data from
their original locations.
